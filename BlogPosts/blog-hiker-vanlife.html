        <h2>Top 5 Exercises for Hikers and Van-Life Adventurers</h2>
        <p>Hiking and living life on the road require strength, mobility, and endurance. Whether you're tackling steep trails or staying active between long drives, these five exercises are designed to help you stay strong and injury-free.</p>

        <h3>1. Step-Ups</h3>
        <p>Build leg power and stability by stepping onto a bench or sturdy surface with added weight, such as a loaded backpack.</p>

        <h3>2. Split Squats</h3>
        <p>Improve balance and single-leg strength, essential for uneven trails and long hikes.</p>

        <h3>3. Plank Shoulder Taps</h3>
        <p>Enhance core stability, which is critical for carrying packs or maintaining good posture during van-life workouts.</p>

        <h3>4. Resistance Band Rows</h3>
        <p>Strengthen your back and shoulders with a lightweight, packable resistance band — perfect for training on the go.</p>

        <h3>5. Glute Bridges</h3>
        <p>Activate and strengthen your glutes to prevent knee pain during long hikes and descents.</p>
